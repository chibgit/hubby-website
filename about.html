    <p>I’ve been a Chelsea fan for years now. My dad is older and has been a Chelsea fan for than decade. Chelsea has been in my family for generations. I’ve seen the dark times and the good times.</p>

    <p>I’ve never felt so disconnected from my club as I do today. This isn’t entirely on the new ownership, I’ve felt this way for a good 6-7 years now, but its worse now than its ever been.</p><br/>

    </p><br/>

    <p>I’ve consistently defended the Clearlake/Boehly ownership. I’ve backed their vision. I’ve confronted critics and make arguments for the ownership. Even last year, at its worst, I defended them. I still believe their intentions for Chelsea to be good, and the level of spending shows they have ambition.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>To be brutally honest, I, and many other fans, am sick and tired of the great institution that is Chelsea Football Club being a joke to rival fans and the media, and public at large. That’s what we are. A joke.
